<p>if it doesn't come bursting out of you <br>
in spite of everything,<br>
don't do it.<br>
unless it comes unasked out of your<br>
heart and your mind and your mouth<br>
and your gut,<br>
don't do it.<br>
if you have to sit for hours<br>
staring at your computer screen<br>
or hunched over your<br>
typewriter<br>
searching for words,<br>
don't do it.<br>
if you're doing it for money or<br>
fame,<br>
don't do it.<br>
if you're doing it because you want<br>
women in your bed,<br>
don't do it.<br>
if you have to sit there and<br>
rewrite it again and again,<br>
don't do it.<br>
if it's hard work just thinking about doing it,<br>
don't do it.<br>
if you're trying to write like somebody<br>
else,<br>
forget about it.<br>
if you have to wait for it to roar out of<br>
you,<br>
then wait patiently.<br>
if it never does roar out of you,<br>
do something else.<br>
<br>
if you first have to read it to your wife<br>
or your girlfriend or your boyfriend<br>
or your parents or to anybody at all,<br>
you're not ready.<br>
<br>
don't be like so many writers,<br>
don't be like so many thousands of<br>
people who call themselves writers,<br>
don't be dull and boring and<br>
pretentious, don't be consumed with self-<br>
love.
the libraries of the world have<br>
yawned themselves to<br>
sleep<br>
over your kind.<br>
don't add to that.<br>
don't do it.<br>
unless it comes out of<br>
your soul like a rocket,<br>
unless being still would<br>
drive you to madness or<br>
suicide or murder,<br>
don't do it.<br>
unless the sun inside you is<br>
burning your gut,<br>
don't do it.<br>
<br>
when it is truly time,<br>
and if you have been chosen,<br>
it will do it by<br>
itself and it will keep on doing it<br>
until you die or it dies in you.<br>
<br>
there is no other way.<br>
<br>
and there never was.<p>
